      <h4> VLx STUDIOS | TECHNOLOGIES LLP PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
      <h3> 1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p><br>VLx STUDIOS ("we," "us" or "our") takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy policy ("Privacy policy") explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information we may process when you use one or more of our mobile applications (the "App", "our App") and explains how we and some of the companies we cooperate processing that information. When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status. Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App ("Users"). If you do not want us to collect, store, use or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you should not play our apps or use our services. For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller.<br>

 

        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED, CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU USE THE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE APP, YOU AGREE TO PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA WHICH IS PROVIDED TO US IN LINE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU<br>
        
         
        
        Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Apps or interact with third party ads in our Apps or with our ads in other publisher’s apps. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our apps and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us or which you allow us to access when you connect to your social network accounts through our Apps. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information). We will sometimes use third party advertising companies to help us collect this data. Further information is provided below in the section titled "Third party advertising companies". A. TECHNICAL INFORMATION
        
        We collect technical information about your device that are necessary for you to use our App and additional technical data that enables us to maintain and analyze the functioning of the App, to personalize the content of the App, and to display advertisements. Such information includes amongst others the type of device(s) you are using to play our Apps, persistent identifiers, such as IP address, device identifiers, ad identifiers, unique user ID specific for our Apps, and the country or region that you are playing in. B. ADVERTISING AND APPLICATION USAGE INFORMATION
        
        When you use our Apps, we collect additional information from you by using persistent identifiers that permit identification of your device.
